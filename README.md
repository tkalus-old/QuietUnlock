Quiet Unlock
============

Simple Android Application for managing Vibrate/Silent Settings

The Impetus
-----------

After looking and looking through the Google Play Store, I couldn't an
app with the specific, very simple feature for managing the phone's
ringer in a semi-automatic way.

* Start the "App" and allow for a selection of Vibrate/Silent.
* Next time the Screen is unlocked, restore the previous setting.
* Allow for turning the screen on to check the time without restoring
  the ringer.

Where To Get It
---------------

Via the Google Play Store.
